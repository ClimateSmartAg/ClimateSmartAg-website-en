CS-DCC: We’re continuing on the training programs with our second training focused on data schemas. Data schemas help document and log data. There is already an abundance of training and resources available for data schemas so this communication will serve as a reminder of where to find the available resources.

- Carly Huitema from the University of Guelph CS-DCC provides training. Below is a link to the Semantic Engine, Climate Smart Agriculture Github, and Carly’s contact information.

CS-DCC: We’re kicking off the training programs with our first training focused on data curation and storage. We’ve all been collecting data, so now what? The next logical step is to figure out how to safely store the data so it is preserved and easily accessible for the future and that it meets the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. Below are links to resources to fit your data storage needs:

- [ADC (Agri-Food Data Canada)](Training Modules & YouTube Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWnVJ7c2CJ59Em-cZPH7CfX7pXdErVD5F)
   
    o	Training videos and resources exist for how to properly format and curate data files up to 5GB onto Borealis.
    
    o	Great for formatting and standardizing.

- [Borealis (for 5 GB or less)](https://borealisdata.ca/)
    
    o	Borealis is a great resource for institutional ingestion of data and licensing

    o	Great for data storage & curation.

- [Federal Research Data Repository (FRDR)](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/)
    
    o	Great for data storage for larger data sets and not limited to just academic institutions.

- [Tripal](Tripal https://tripal.info/index.php/about)
    
    o	Great for biological (genetics, genomics, breeding) community database.

- Other resources
    
    o	[Bento](https://github.com/bento-platform/bento)
    
    o [Gen3](https://gen3.org/)

Additional Resources from University of Guelph (U of G) and the Digital Resource Alliance of Canada (DRAC):

AG-ACt is pleased to be hosting an *Indigenous Engagement Training Session* on June 25 from 1:00 - 2:30pm EST. This session will be held virtually over zoom and recorded for your convenience.  
Please register [here](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/Za6OdVqOReqUlcD0hvIx_g)

This training session is designed specifically for agricultural researchers in Canada—especially those supported by the Agricultural Genomics Action Center (AG-ACt).  
The session offers practical, research-focused guidance on how, when, and why to engage Indigenous Peoples throughout your research process. Unlike broad EDI or health-focused trainings, this content is tailored to the realities of agri-food research. This training provides essential tools for inclusive, impactful research. 

You’ll gain insights into: 
Building respectful, reciprocal relationships; 
Navigating ethical frameworks such as OCAP and UNDRIP; 
Aligning research approaches with Indigenous values and priorities; and 
Enhancing your grant proposals and knowledge mobilization plans. 

Who is this for: Members of the ICT teams, hubs, and partners who are interested in learning more about respectful and reciprocal Indigenous engagement for your research. We welcome PIs, staff, project leads, HQPs (students, post-docs), and any project partners.  
This session will be facilitated by Emily Nanne, Indigenous Engagement Advisor, and hosted by AG-ACt.

## External organizations
- [Digital Research Alliance of Canada - DRAC](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/) has introduced their search engine Explora. Users can search Explora for workshops, webinars, bootcamps, and other training events across Canada designed to help researchers at any career stage develop skills in advanced research computing, research data management, and research software.

- The FRDR curation services team at the Digital Research Alliance of Canada is pleased to invite you to participate in The Curation Clinic: Essentials for depositing research data. We will discuss how to collaborate with researchers on the essential components of well-documented data deposits, such as titles, descriptions, keywords, READMEs, and codebooks.

  What to expect:
    - Experiences and discussions about improving dataset metadata
    - Sharing suitable tools to streamline dataset descriptions
    - Examples of key elements in titles, descriptions, and README files
    - Community members' questions and exchanges with curator peers.

  We want these sessions to be engaging, collaborative and, most importantly, useful for your professional role. Whether you're just curious or actively working     through a tricky dataset, we welcome your participation.
